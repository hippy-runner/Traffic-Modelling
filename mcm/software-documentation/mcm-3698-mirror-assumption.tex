\begin{document}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We do not need to simulate traffic that drives on the left side of the road (i.e., traffic in the United Kingdom).
\end{enumerate}
	
	We are making the assumption that traffic that drives on the left side of the road is simply a mirror image of traffic that drives on the right side of the road, such as in the United States. Thus, staying right except to pass on the left is the same as staying left except to pass on the right. Additionally, switching lanes to the left is assumed to be the same as switching lanes on the right.
